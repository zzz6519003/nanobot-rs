/// The agent loop is responsible for:
/// - Receiving messages from the message bus
/// - Processing messages through the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) cycle
/// - Managing concurrent sessions with per-session locks
/// - Coordinating with LLM providers and tool execution
/// - Persisting conversation history
///
/// # Design Principles
///
/// - **Session Isolation**: Each session has its own lock to prevent race conditions
/// - **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple sessions can be processed in parallel
/// - **Error Recovery**: Tool errors are wrapped as text prompts, not fatal
/// - **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of MCP connections and active tasks

/// # Progressive Disclosure Design
///
/// Skills follow a progressive disclosure pattern to minimize context usage:
///
/// 1. **Discovery Phase** (`build_skills_summary`):
///    - Shows only skill names, descriptions, and availability
///    - Presented as XML summary in system prompt
///    - Agent can see what skills exist without loading full content
///
/// 2. **Loading Phase** (`load_skill`):
///    - Full skill content loaded only when agent explicitly reads the SKILL.md file
///    - Agent uses `read_file` tool to access skill details on-demand
///    - Keeps context window lean until skill is actually needed
///
/// 3. **Always-On Skills** (`get_always_skills`):
///    - Exception to progressive disclosure
///    - Skills marked with `always: true` are loaded into every context
///    - Use sparingly for critical, frequently-needed skills
///
/// This design ensures the agent can discover hundreds of skills without
/// consuming context, loading full details only when relevant.
