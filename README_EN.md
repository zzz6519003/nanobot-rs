[中文](./README.md) | English

`nanobot` is a local AI agent runtime implemented in Rust, featuring:

- Single-shot and interactive CLI chat
- Gateway mode with channel dispatch
- Native `Anthropic Messages` and `OpenAI-compatible` providers (`responses` and `chat_completions`)
- Tooling: filesystem, shell, web, messaging, subagent, cron, MCP, ACP
- Local session persistence, memory, heartbeat, and scheduling

> ⚠️ Project positioning: `nanobot` is currently intended for learning and research, and is not recommended for production use.

## Use Cases

- Build an extensible local AI agent quickly
- Connect multi-turn conversations and tool calls via Telegram/CLI
- Switch between OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible gateways with one config format

## Current Capability Status

- **Providers**: `anthropic`, `openai`, `custom`, plus arbitrary custom provider keys (HashMap-based)
- **Channels**: `CLI` (available), `Telegram` (available), `Discord/Feishu` (placeholder)
- **Run modes**: `agent` (interactive/single-shot) and `gateway` (channels + scheduler + heartbeat)

      "model": "deepseek-v4-flash",
      "apiBase": "https://api.deepseek.com",
      "apiKey": "{{DEEPSEEK_API_KEY}}"
    }
  }
}
```
